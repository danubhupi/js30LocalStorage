# JS30EventDelegation  In this task I learned about Event Delegation ,itis when a event is added to a parent and when the event is invoke it is checked for the target child element if it is activated on that child element too then further steps are executed, it is also used when children maybe added in the future,so the event handler is just attached to the parent instead of individual children

Used and learned about local storage and event delegation, event delegation is basically adding an event to a parent rather than a child and then filtering the target of to check whether event is invoked for a certain child or not. It can be used in cases where new children elements maybe added over time.
